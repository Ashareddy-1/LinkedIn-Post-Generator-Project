LinkedIn-Post-Generator-Project

This repository contains a modular pipeline for generating text (e.g., social media posts, summaries, etc.) using large language models (LLMs). It includes preprocessing, few-shot prompting, post generation, and helper utilities.

🚀 Features

✂️ Preprocessing: Clean and structure input text.

🧪 Few-shot Prompting: Use examples to guide LLM responses.

🛠 Modular Design: Each step is implemented as a standalone module.

🤖 LLM Integration: Interact with large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).

📝 Post Generation: Automatically generate social media posts, summaries, or articles.

⚙️ Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

python main.py

You can also run specific modules:

python preprocess.py          # Run preprocessing only

python post_generator.py      # Generate output from processed input

🔐 Environment Setup

Make sure to configure your LLM API key (if needed):

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

Or store it securely in a .env file if supported.

📚 File Descriptions

few_shot.py – Contains prompt examples for guiding LLM output.

llm_helper.py – Handles API calls and error handling for language models.

preprocess.py – Text formatting, cleanup, and tokenization.

post_generator.py – Uses processed data and prompts to generate content.

main.py – Orchestrates the full flow: preprocessing → prompting → generation.

✅ Example Use Cases

✍️ Social media post automation

📰 News summarization

📚 Content generation for blogs
